# BrainFuckPlus
An extended interpreter for original esotaric language - [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) <br/>
This extension can also interprete original Brainfuck

## Examples
All examples are stored in /examples/ folder <br/>
I mostly name variables as `adrX` or `vrX`, but by original code they seems to be `cells` 

## BrainFkPlus.Extension
Lives in /src/BrainFkPlus.Extension/ <br/>
It adds several operators:
* `* - multiply`
* `/ - division`
* `_ - write current value to console`
* `; - endl (new line)`
* `? - write current index to console`
